# node-lib-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for a simple [node.js](http://nodejs.org) library. It is meant to be cloned with [bp](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp).

## Cloning
You *can* clone it manually, but it's much easier to use [bp](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp):

```sh
$ bp code-boilerplates/node-lib-boilerplate my-cool-lib
```

(Replace 'my-cool-lib' with the name of your library.)

## Post-clone setup
After you clone it, you will need to fill out some fields in the package.json file (depencies, repository, etc.). Other than that, you're good to go!
